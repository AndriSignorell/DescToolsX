\item{x}{integer number for which the divisors are to be returned}
}

\description{
Calculate divisors of positive natural numbers.

\details{
Divisibility is a mathematical relationship between two integers. An integer
is divisible by another integer if there is no remainder in the division.
The number 11 has only two divisors: 1 and the number 11 itself, whereas the
number 12 has many divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.  In elementary number
theory, the concept of divisibility is limited to natural numbers.  The
number of its divisors can be determined with the function
\code{\link{length}()}.
