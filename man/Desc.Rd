\item{x}{An object to be described.}

An object of class \code{"Desc"} with a subclass depending on
the input type.

\description{
Create descriptive summaries for different types of objects.

\details{
\code{Desc()} is an S3 generic that computes basic descriptive statistics
depending on the class of its input. The result is an object of class
\code{"Desc"} with a more specific subclass such as
\code{"Desc.numeric"}, \code{"Desc.factor"} or \code{"Desc.data.frame"}.

For numeric vectors, summary statistics such as mean and standard deviation
are computed. For factors, frequency tables are returned. For data frames,
\code{Desc()} is applied column-wise.

\code{Desc} is a \strong{generic function}. It dispatches to the
method of the class of its first argument. Typing
\code{?Desc} + TAB at the prompt should present a choice of links: the help
pages for each of these \code{Desc} methods. You don't need to
use the full name of the method although you may if you wish;
i.e., \code{Desc(x)} is idiomatic R but you can bypass method
dispatch by going direct if you wish: \code{Desc.numeric(x)}.
