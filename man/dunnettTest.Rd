\title{Dunnett's Test for Comparing Several Treatments With a Control}
\usage{
dunnettTest(x, ...)

\method{dunnettTest}{formula}(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...)

\method{dunnettTest}{default}(x, g, control = NULL, conf.level = 0.95, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector of data values, or a list of numeric data vectors.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments to be passed to or from methods.}

\item{formula}{a formula of the form \code{lhs ~ rhs} where \code{lhs} gives
the data values and \code{rhs} the corresponding groups.}

\item{data}{an optional matrix or data frame (or similar: see
\code{\link{model.frame}}) containing the variables in the formula
\code{formula}.  By default the variables are taken from
\code{environment(formula)}.}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
used.}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data
contain \code{NA}s.  Defaults to \code{getOption("na.action")}.}

\item{g}{a vector or factor object giving the group for the corresponding
elements of \code{x}.  Ignored if \code{x} is a list.}

\item{control}{the level of the control group against which the others
should be tested. If there are multiple levels the calculation will be
performed for every one.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the interval. \%\% ~~Describe
\code{conf.level} here~~}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{c("PostHocTest")}, containing one matrix named
after the control with columns \code{diff} giving the difference in the
observed means, \code{lwr.ci} giving the lower end point of the interval,
\code{upr.ci} giving the upper end point and \code{pval} giving the p-value
after adjustment for the multiple comparisons.

There are print and plot methods for class \code{"PostHocTest"}. The plot
method does not accept \code{xlab}, \code{ylab} or \code{main} arguments and
creates its own values for each plot.
}
\description{
Performs Dunnett's test for comparing several treatments with a control.
}
\details{
\code{dunnettTest} does the post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons
procedure.

If \code{x} is a list, its elements are taken as the samples to be compared,
and hence have to be numeric data vectors.  In this case, \code{g} is
ignored, and one can simply use \code{dunnettTest(x)} to perform the test.
If the samples are not yet contained in a list, use
\code{dunnettTest(list(x, ...))}.

Otherwise, \code{x} must be a numeric data vector, and \code{g} must be a
vector or factor object of the same length as \code{x} giving the group for
the corresponding elements of \code{x}.

\examples{

## Hollander & Wolfe (1973), 116.
## Mucociliary efficiency from the rate of removal of dust in normal
##  subjects, subjects with obstructive airway disease, and subjects
##  with asbestosis.
x <- c(2.9, 3.0, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2) # normal subjects
y <- c(3.8, 2.7, 4.0, 2.4)      # with obstructive airway disease
z <- c(2.8, 3.4, 3.7, 2.2, 2.0) # with asbestosis

dunnettTest(list(x, y, z))

## Equivalently,
x <- c(x, y, z)
g <- factor(rep(1:3, c(5, 4, 5)),
            labels = c("Normal subjects",
                       "Subjects with obstructive airway disease",
                       "Subjects with asbestosis"))

dunnettTest(x, g)

## Formula interface
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
dunnettTest(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)

dunnettTest(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality, control="8", conf.level=0.9)
