\title{Reshape a Vector From Long to Wide Shape Or Vice Versa}
\usage{
toLong(x, varnames = NULL, incl.rownames = FALSE)

toWide(x, g, by = NULL, varnames = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the vector to be reshaped}

\item{varnames}{the variable names if not the grouping levels should be
used.}

\item{incl.rownames}{logical (default \code{FALSE}), if set to \code{TRUE} a
column containing the rownames will be appended at the end of the
data.frame.}

\item{g}{the grouping vector to be used for the new columns. The resulting
\code{data.frame} will return one column per grouplevel.}

\item{by}{a vector to be used to merge the pieces of \code{x}. If this is
left to \code{NULL} the pieces will be merged by rownames in the order they
are supplied.}
}
\value{
the reshaped object of \code{data.frame} class
}
\description{
Simple reshaping a vector from long to wide or from wide to long shape by
means of a single factor.
}
\details{
\code{toLong} expects x as a matrix or a data.frame and reshapes it to a
(long) factor representation. \code{toWide} expects the vectors x, g, by,
wheras x being the variable, g the splitting factor and by a vector for
rowwise merging.
