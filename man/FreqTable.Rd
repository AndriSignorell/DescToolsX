\title{Frequency Table for a Single Variable}
\usage{
Freq(
  x,
  breaks = hist(x, plot = FALSE)$breaks,
  include.lowest = TRUE,
  ord = c("level", "desc", "asc", "name"),
  useNA = c("no", "ifany", "always"),
  ...
)

\method{print}{Freq}(x, digits = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the variable to be described, can be any atomic type.}

\item{breaks}{either a numeric vector of two or more cut points or a single
number (greater than or equal to 2) giving the number of intervals into
which x is to be cut. Default taken from the function \code{hist()}.  This
is ignored if x is not of numeric type.}

\item{include.lowest}{logical, indicating if an \verb{x[i]} equal to the lowest (or
highest, for \code{right = FALSE}) \code{"breaks"} value should be included.
Ignored if x is not of numeric type.}

\item{ord}{how should the result be ordered? Default is \code{"level"},
other choices are 'by frequency' (\code{"descending"} or \code{"ascending"})
or 'by name of the levels' (\code{"name"}). The argument can be abbreviated.
This is ignored if x is numeric.}

\item{useNA}{one out of \code{"no"}, \code{"ifany"}, \code{"always"}.
Defines whether to include extra \code{NA} levels in the table.  Defaults to
\code{"no"} which is the \code{\link{table}()} default too.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments are passed to the function
\code{\link{cut}()}. Use \code{dig.lab} to control the format of numeric
group names. Use the argument \code{right} to define if the intervals should
be closed on the right (and open on the left) or vice versa. \cr In
\code{print.Freq} the dots are not used.}

\item{digits}{integer, determining the number of digits used to format the
relative frequencies.}
}
\value{
an object of type \code{"Freq"}, which is basically a data.frame
with 5 columns (earning a specific print routine), containing the following
components: \item{level}{ factor. The levels of the grouping variable.}
\item{freq}{ integer. The absolute frequencies. } \item{perc}{ numeric. The
relative frequencies (percent).} \item{cumfreq}{integer. The cumulative sum
of the absolute frequencies.} \item{cumperc}{numeric. The cumulative sum of
the relative frequencies.}
}
\description{
Calculates absolute and relative frequencies of a vector \code{x}.
Continuous (numeric) variables will be cut using the same logic as used by
the function \code{\link{hist}}. Categorical variables will be aggregated by
\code{\link{table}}. The result will contain single and cumulative
frequencies for both, absolute values and percentages.
}
\details{
By default only the valid cases are considered for the frequencies, say
\code{NA} values are excluded. (This is in accordance with the default
behavior of the R function \code{table}, which seemed a reasonable
reference.) If the \code{NA}s should be included you can set the
\code{useNA} argument to either \code{"ifany"} or \code{"always"}.

For numeric variables, if \code{breaks} is specified as a single number, the
range of the data is divided into breaks pieces of equal length, and then
the outer limits are moved away by 0.1\\% of the range to ensure that the
extreme values both fall within the break intervals. (If \code{x} is a
constant vector, equal-length intervals are created that cover the single
value.) See \code{\link{cut}}.

\examples{

data(d.pizza)

# result is a data.frame
d.freq <- Freq(d.pizza$price)
d.freq

# it is printed by default with 3 digits for the percent values,
# but the number of digits can be defined in the print function
print(d.freq, digits=5)

# sorted by frequency
Freq(d.pizza$driver, ord="desc")

# sorted by name using all the observations, say including NAs
Freq(d.pizza$driver, ord="name", useNA="ifany")

# percentages and cumulative frequencies for a vector of count data
Freq(as.table(c(2,4,12,8)))
