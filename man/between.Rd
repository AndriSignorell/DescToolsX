\arguments{
\item{x}{is a variable with at least ordinal scale, usually a numeric value,
but can be an ordered factor or a text as well. Texts would be treated
alphabetically.}

\item{rng}{a vector of two values or a matrix with 2 columns, defining the
minimum and maximum of the range for x. \cr If rng is a matrix, x or rng
will be recycled.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of the same length as x.
}
\description{
The between and outside operators are used to check, whether a vector of
given values x lie within a defined range (or outside respectively). The
values can be numbers, text or dates. Ordered factors are supported.
}
\details{
The "BETWEEN" operators basically combine two conditional statements into
one and simplify the query process.\cr They are merely a wrapper for:
\code{x >= rng[1] & x <= rng[2]}, where the round bracket \code{(} means
\emph{strictly greater (>)} and the square bracket \code{[} means
\emph{greater or equal (>=)}.  Numerical values of x will be handled by
C-code, which is significantly faster than two comparisons in R (especially
when x is huge). .\cr \code{\%][\%} is the negation of \code{\%()\%}, meaning
all values lying outside the given range. Elements on the limits will return
\code{TRUE}.

Both arguments, \code{x} and \code{rng}, will be recycled to the highest
dimension, which is either the length of the vector (\code{x}) or the number
of rows of the matrix (\code{rng}).\cr See also the routines used to check,
whether two ranges overlap (\code{\link[DescTools]{Overlap}},
\code{\link[DescTools]{Interval}}).

\code{\%:\%} returns all the elements of a vector between the (first found)
element \code{rng[1]} and \code{rng[2]}. If no match is found it returns
\code{NA}. If \code{rng[2]} occurs before \code{rng[1]} in the vector the
elements will be returned in reverse order (which is the same behaviour as
the \code{:} operator). \cr \code{\%::\%} does the same in greedy mood. It
uses the first match for \code{from} and the last match for \code{to}. \cr

\examples{

x <- 1:9
x \%[]\% c(3,5)

# outside
x <- 1:9
x \%][\% c(3,5)

c(x,NA) \%[]\% c(3,5)

x \%(]\% c(3,5)

# no result when from > to:
x \%[]\% c(5,3)
x \%(]\% c(5,5)

# no problem:
ordered(x) \%[]\% c(3,5)

# not meaningful:
factor(x) \%[]\% c(3,5)

# characters
letters[letters \%(]\% c("d","h")]

data(d.pizza)
x <- levels(d.pizza$driver)
x \%[]\% c("C","G")

# select pizzas with a temperature between 50 and 55
d.pizza[na.omit(d.pizza$temperature \%[]\% c(63, 65)),]

# use it with an ordered factor and select all diamonds with
#   symmetry between G (included) and X (excluded).
# mean(d.diamonds[d.diamonds$symmetry \%[)\% c("G","X"),"price"])


# use multiple ranges
2 \%[]\% cbind(1:4,2:5)

# both arguments are recycled
c(2,3) \%[]\% cbind(1:4,2:5)


# between operator for vector positions
set.seed(4)
(x <- sample(LETTERS, size=10, replace=TRUE))
# [1] "X" "K" "S" "C" "G" "L" "S" "V" "U" "Z"

# return all elements between "S" and "L" 
x \%:\% c("S","L")
# [1] "S" "C" "G" "L"
 
x \%:\% c("S","A")
# [1] "S" "C" "G" "L" "S" "V" "U" "Z"
 
x \%:\% c("A","S")
# [1] "X" "K" "S"

# reverted matches return the elements in reverse order
x \%:\% c("G","X")
# [1] "G" "C" "S" "K" "X"

# no match results in NA
x \%:\% c("Y","B")

(x <- c("B", "A", "X", "K", "S", "K", "G", "L", "K", "V", "K", "Z"))
