\description{
An artificial dataset inspired by a similar dataset pizza.sav in
\emph{Arbeitsbuch zur deskriptiven und induktiven Statistik} by Toutenburg
et.al.\cr The dataset contains data of a pizza delivery service in London,
delivering pizzas to three areas. Every record defines one order/delivery
and the according properties. A pizza is supposed to taste good, if its
temperature is high enough, say 45 Celsius. So it might be interesting for
the pizza delivery service to minimize the delivery time.\cr The dataset is
designed to be as evil as possible. As far as the description is concerned,
it should pose the same difficulties that we have to deal with in everyday
life. It contains the most used datatypes as numerics, factors, ordered
factors, integers, logicals and a date. NAs are scattered everywhere partly
systematically, partly randomly (except in the index).

\details{
The dataset contains NAs randomly scattered.
