\title{Shapiro-Francia test for normality}
\usage{
shapiroFranciaTest(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector of data values, the number of which must be
between 5 and 5000. Missing values are allowed.}
}
\value{
A list with class \dQuote{htest} containing the following
components: \item{statistic}{the value of the Shapiro-Francia statistic.}
\item{p.value }{the p-value for the test.} \item{method}{the character
string \dQuote{Shapiro-Francia normality test}.} \item{data.name}{a
character string giving the name(s) of the data.}
}
\description{
Performs the Shapiro-Francia test for the composite hypothesis of normality,
see e.g. Thode (2002, Sec. 2.3.2).
}
\details{
The test statistic of the Shapiro-Francia test is simply the squared
correlation between the ordered sample values and the (approximated)
expected ordered quantiles from the standard normal distribution. The
p-value is computed from the formula given by Royston (1993).
}
\note{
The Shapiro-Francia test is known to perform well, see also the
comments by Royston (1993). The expected ordered quantiles from the standard
normal distribution are approximated by \code{qnorm(ppoints(x, a = 3/8))},
being slightly different from the approximation \code{qnorm(ppoints(x, a =
1/2))} used for the normal quantile-quantile plot by \code{\link{qqnorm}}
for sample sizes greater than 10.
