\title{Kth Smallest/Largest Values}
\usage{
large(x, k = 5L, unique = FALSE, na.last = NA)

small(x, k = 5L, unique = FALSE, na.last = NA)

highLow(x, nlow = 5L, nhigh = nlow, na.last = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{numeric} vector}

\item{k}{an integer >0 defining how many extreme values should be returned.
Default is \code{k = 5}. If \code{k > length(x)}, all values will be
returned.}

\item{unique}{logical, defining if unique values should be considered or
not. If this is set to \code{TRUE}, a list with the \code{k} extreme values
and their frequencies is returned. Default is \code{FALSE} (as unique is a
rather expensive function).}

\item{na.last}{for controlling the treatment of \code{NA}s.  If \code{TRUE},
missing values in the data are put last; if \code{FALSE}, they are put
first; if \code{NA}, they are removed.}

\item{nlow}{a single integer. The number of the smallest elements of a
vector to be printed. Defaults to 5.}

\item{nhigh}{a single integer. The number of the greatest elements of a
vector to be printed. Defaults to the number of \code{nlow}.}
}
\value{
if \code{unique} is set to \code{FALSE}: a vector with the k most
extreme values, \cr else: a list, containing the k most extreme values and
their frequencies.
}
\description{
Find the kth smallest, resp. largest values from a vector \code{x} and
return the values and their frequencies.
}
\details{
This does not seem to be a difficult problem at first sight. We could simply
tabulate and sort the vector and finally take the first or last k values.
However sorting and tabulating the whole vector when we're just interested
in the few smallest values is a considerable waste of resources. This
approach becomes already impracticable for medium vector lengths
(~\ifelse{html}{10\out{<sup>5</sup>}}{\eqn{10^5}}). There are several points and
solutions of this problem discussed out there. The present implementation is
based on highly efficient C++ code and proved to be very fast.

HighLow combines the two upper functions and reports the k extreme values on
both sides together with their frequencies in parentheses. It is used for
describing univariate variables and is interesting for checking the ends of
the vector, where in real data often wrong values accumulate. This is in
essence a printing routine for the highest and the lowest values of x.

\examples{

x <- sample(1:10, 1000, rep=TRUE)
large(x, 3)
large(x, k=3, unique=TRUE)

# works fine up to x ~ 1e6
x <- runif(1000000)
small(x, 3, unique=TRUE)
small(x, 3, unique=FALSE)

# Both ends
cat(highLow(d.pizza$temperature, na.last=NA))
