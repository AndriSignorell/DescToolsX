\arguments{
\item{x}{the object to be described. This can be a data.frame, a list, a
table or a vector of the classes: numeric, integer, factor, ordered factor,
logical.}

\item{maxrows}{numeric; defines the maximum number of rows in a frequency
table to be reported. For factors with many levels it is often not
interesting to see all of them. Default is set to 12 most frequent ones
(resp. the first ones if \code{ord} is set to \code{"levels"} or
\code{"names"}).

For a numeric argument x \code{maxrows} is the minimum number of unique
values needed for a numeric variable to be treated as continuous. If left to
its default \code{NULL}, x will be regarded as continuous if it has more
than 12 single values. In this case the list of extreme values will be
displayed and the frequency table else.

If \code{maxrows} is < 1 it will be interpreted as percentage. In this case
just as many rows, as the \code{maxrows} most frequent levels will be shown.
Say, if \code{maxrows} is set to \code{0.8}, then the number of rows is
fixed so, that the highest cumulative relative frequency is the first one
going beyond 0.8.

Setting \code{maxrows} to \code{Inf} will unconditionally report all values
and also produce a plot with type "h" instead of a histogram.}

\item{ord}{character out of \code{"name"} (alphabetical order),
\code{"level"}, \code{"asc"} (by frequencies ascending), \code{"desc"} (by
frequencies descending) defining the order for a frequency table as used for
factors, numerics with few unique values and logicals. Factors (and
character vectors) are by default ordered by their descending frequencies,
ordered factors by their natural order.}

\item{main}{(character|\code{NULL}|\code{NA}), the main title(s). \itemize{
\item If \code{NULL}, the title will be composed as: \itemize{ \item
variable name (class(es)), \item resp. number - variable name (class(es)) if
the \code{enum} option is set to \code{TRUE.} } \item Use \code{NA} if no
caption should be printed at all. }}

\item{plotit}{logical. Should a plot be created? The plot type will be
chosen according to the classes of variables (roughly following a
numeric-numeric, numeric-categorical, categorical-categorical logic).
Default can be defined by option \code{plotit}, if it does not exist then
it's set to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{digits}{integer. With how many digits should the relative frequencies
be formatted? Default can be set by
\link[=setDescToolsXOption]{setDescToolsXOption(digits=x)}.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments to be passed to or from other methods}

\item{maxlablen}{maximal character length for the labels}

\item{type}{type of plot bar/dot}

\item{col}{the color of the bars}

\item{border}{the border color of the bars}

\item{xlim}{limitation for the x-axis}

\item{ecdf}{boolean, should the cumulative distribution function be
included? (default \code{TRUE})}
}
\description{
Displays a set of statistical measures describing a factor.
Visualizes the distribution of a numeric \code{Desc} object.
The plot consists of a pair of horizontally organized barplots
displaying the absolute and relative frequencies.
}
\details{
This function produces a rich description of a \strong{factor}, containing
length, number of NAs, number of levels and detailed frequencies of all
levels. The order of the frequency table can be chosen between
descending/ascending frequency, labels or levels. For ordered factors the
order default is \code{"level"}. Character vectors are treated as unordered
factors Desc.char converts x to a factor an processes x as factor.\cr
Desc.ordered does nothing more than changing the standard order for the
frequencies to it's intrinsic order, which means order \code{"level"}
instead of \code{"desc"} in the factor case.
