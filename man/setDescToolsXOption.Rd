\usage{
setDescToolsXOption(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{any options can be defined, using \code{name = value}. However,
only the ones below are used by DescTools functions.}
}
\value{
For a given vector of strings the current value set for option \code{x}, or
\code{NULL} if the option is unset.

If called with no arguments, returns all option settings in a list.
Otherwise, it changes the named settings and invisibly returns their
previous values.
}
\description{
Get and set a variety of options which affect the way in which DescTools
functions display results.
}
\details{
Invoking \code{DescToolsOptions()} with no arguments returns a list with the
current values of the options. Note that not all options listed below are
set initially. To access the value of a single option, one can simply use
\code{DescToolsOptions("plotit")}.\cr To set a new value use the same
rationale as with the R options: \code{DescToolsOptions(plotit=FALSE)}

Calling \code{DescToolsOptions(reset=TRUE)} will reset the options to these
defaults: \preformatted{ options(DescTools = list( col = c(hblue="#8296C4",
hred="#9A0941", horange="#F08100"), digits = 3, fixedfont =
structure(list(name = "Consolas", size = 7), class = "font"), fmt = list(abs
= structure(list(digits = 0, big.mark = "'"), name = "abs", label = "Number
format for counts", default = TRUE, class = "fmt"), per =
structure(list(digits = 1, fmt = "%"), name = "per", label = "Percentage
number format", default = TRUE, class = "fmt"), num = structure(list(digits
= 3, big.mark = "'"), name = "num", label = "Number format for floats",
default = TRUE, class = "fmt") ), footnote = c("'", "\"", "\"\""), lang =
"en", plotit = TRUE, stamp = expression(gettextf("%s/%s",
Sys.getenv("USERNAME"), Format(Today(), fmt = "yyyy-mm-dd"))) )) }

This code can as well be copied and pasted to the users' \code{RProfile}
file, in order to have the options permanently available.
